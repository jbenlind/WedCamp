Basically I think they were just trying to pack up early. The second thing that happened was that they gave our wedding suite away by accident. They had a room for us but it wasn't the suite we had reserved. I wasn't too happy about that, but luckily we had a place to sleep. And they gave us another night stay for free because of it, so we are going to go back and celebrate our 1 year anniversary there. Besides those two things, everything was perfect! :)",

After speaking with Tom, he gave me some recommendations from everything from the caterer to the DJ based on what he knew I wanted and those vendors were also excellent. Both my husband and I have been in constant awe since the wedding because friends and family had said that it may be one of the most beautiful wedding venues they've ever been to.

We were very thankful that they even thought to spray for mosquitos! The barn and surrounding grounds are absolutely breathtaking, and we especially enjoyed the many unique places on the grounds for photographs and for our guests to explore! The grooms quarters and the bride‚Äôs house were both perfect to escape the commotion and to freshen up in advance of our ceremony (also great for pictures). The lower level of the barn was set up for a rustic cocktail hour and the 2nd floor worked beautifully for reception and dancing. We were worried it would get hot inside the barn during the summer but the large barn windows allowed a very refreshing breeze to come in. We would highly recommend Farm at Dover for any couple looking to get married in a gorgeous rustic location.",
